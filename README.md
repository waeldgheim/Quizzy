## Project Overview

Quizzy is an AI-driven platform designed to help students and learners extract useful study material from any document (PDF, Word). Users can upload a document and instantly get:

- **Summary Notes** – concise highlights of the content.  
- **Flashcards** – key concepts and definitions for memorization.  
- **MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions)** – practice questions for self-assessment.  

The platform also allows users to:

- **Save their study sessions.**  
- **Name and organize sessions for easy retrieval.**  
- **Delete unnecessary sessions.**  
- **Manage user tiers** (free initially, with paid plans planned for later).
